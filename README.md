# OOAD-Project

Once we've got our text description and a UML diagram we can decide how lay out our code just so we all work
in a somewhat similar style, it'll look nicer and be easier for us to follow and edit.

If you guys want to submit and review each others pull requests I don't mind looking at
code before we commit it to the main, but please create a branch before you work with any of the code.
If we all just work in the main we might update a file that's also used by something someone else is working on
and I don't want to spend a while implementing something, just to have a file I'm taking data from to get changed.
